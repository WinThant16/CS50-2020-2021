                    <p class="infotextp"><b>Piplup</b> is a light-blue, penguin-like Pokémon with a strong sense of self-pride.
                    It lives along the seashore in colder climates. There are two white ovals on its chest and a small, light-blue marking resembles a crown above its beak. It has flipper-like arms and yellow feet with three toes each.
                    <b>Piplup</b> has a strong sense of self-pride. Because of its pride, it does not usually accept food from humans and makes it difficult to bond with its caretakers. It has trouble walking on land but it is a skilled swimmer.
                    It lives along the seashore in colder climates.
                    It evolves into <b>Prinplup</b> which gradually evolves into
                    <b>Empoleon</b>.</p>
                    <p class="infotextp"><b>Prinplup</b> is a blue, penguin-like Pokémon. Instead of arms, it has long wings that resemble flippers. These wings are strong enough to
                    knock down trees. It also has a high sense of self-pride, which prevents it from forming groups of its kind. <b>Prinplups</b> can be foun in icy waters.</p>
                    <p class="infotextp"><b>Empoleon</b> is a large, navy-blue penguin-like Pokémon. It has a yellow beak that extends into three pointed horns that form a trident-shaped crest
                    on its face. Large horns are a symbol of leadership and strength. On it's back are two raised gold bumps and a blue film that forms its tail. The edges of its wings can slice through
                    ice floes. <b>Empoleons</b> will attack anyone that damages its pride.</p>
                    <p class="infotextp"><b>Piplups</b> and <b>Prinplups</b> have only water attributes, but Empoleons have Steel and Water as its type.</p>
                    <p class="infotextp">They are strong against Fire, Ground and Rock type Pokémons.</p>
                    <p class="infotextp">But they are weak against Grass and Electric type Pokémons.</p>
                    <p class="infotextp"><b>Empoleons</b> are also weak to Fighting type Pokémons.</p>
