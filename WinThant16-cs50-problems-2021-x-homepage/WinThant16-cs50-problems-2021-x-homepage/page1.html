                    <p class="infotextc"><b>Chimchar</b> is a Pokémon resembling a chimpanzee. It's fur is generally
                    a shade of orange. Its rear has a small, round, red patch that is usually obscured by flames produced
                    by burning gas in its stomach. These flames go out when it goes to sleep, and burn weakly when it feels ill.
                    It has two pointed teeth in its upper jaw and a swirly crest of hair on its head.
                    Being very agile, it is able to climb the rocky ledges of tall mountains, where it lives.
                    It evolves into <b>Monferno</b> which gradually evolves into <b>Infernape</b>.</p>
                    <p class="infotextc"><b>Monferno</b> is similar to a primeate.
                    The flame on Monferno's tail has several purposes. It can be controlled to keep opponents at an ideal distance
                    or stretched in order to make <b>Monferno</b> appear larger. The size and brightness of its flame indicates this Pokémon's
                    position in its pack. The bigger the flame and the brighter the pattern, the higher the Pokémon's position.
                    In addition to using its flaming tail as a weapon, <b>Monferno</b> can also leap from ceilings or walls to perform aerial attacks.</p>
                    <p class="infotextc"><b>Infernape</b> is a primate-like Pokémon that is primarily reddish-brown with sections of white fur
                    on its chest, head, and lower legs. There are several gold markings on its body. On top of its head is a large flame
                    that is never extinguished. This quick Pokémon uses a kind of martial arts with fiery punches and kicks to fend off its foes.</p>
                    <p class="infotextc"><b>Chimchars</b> are Fire type Pokémons, but <b>Monfernos</b> and <b>Infernapes</b> are dual-type Fire/Fighting Pokémons.</p>
                    <p class="infotextc">They are generally strong against Grass, Bug, Ice, and Steel Pokémons.</p>
                    <p class="infotextc">But they are generally weak against Water Pokémons.</p>
                    <p class="infotextc"><b>Monfernos</b> and <b>Infernapes</b> are also weak against Flying, Psychic and Fairy Pokémons because they are also of a Fighting type.</p>
